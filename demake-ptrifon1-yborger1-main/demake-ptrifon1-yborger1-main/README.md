# Demake Project

**DUE November 31st at 11:59 PM**

You and your partner will port a **modern** (> 1989) game to the
NES. You do not have to recreate every aspect of the original game,
but your demake should capture the essence of the original game. Be
mindful of taking advantage of the NES's affordances, in other words,
what aspects of the original game does the NES make it easy to
reimagine.  Mobile and web games (e.g., [2048](https://play2048.co/),
[flappy bird](https://flappybird.io/)) are probably the easiest, but the
more obscure the better.

## Goals

- understand what makes the original game special;
- create a working reimaginiation of the game for the NES;
- develop a game in C for the NES; 
- write about the original and your demake.

## Learning Objectives

- distill a modern game to its essence;
- understand the NES PPU;
- develop a game using C;
- think and write critically about games.

## Deliverable

Submit your demake study on GitHub (a markdown document). You can use
8-bit workshop do develop and share your game, but also commit the
source code to github. Your write-up should be clear and look
nice. You will present your work during the lab period.
