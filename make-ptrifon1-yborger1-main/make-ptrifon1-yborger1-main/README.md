# Make Project

**DUE Dec 18th at 11:59 PM**

You will develop your own 8-bit game for the final project. You can
use TIC-80, NES, or the VCS. You can work alone or with a partner. You
can create an original game, or mash-up existing games, but your game
should be more than simply a remake; be creative!

One of the key outcomes of this assignment is to reflect on the design
of the game from a software point of view. Use some of the game
programming patterns we covered in class. 

## Alternative Options

- improve upon your REMAKE;
- improve upon your DEMAKE;
- port your DEMAKE to TIC-80.


## Learning Objectives

- develop a novel video game;
- more practice with Lua (C or 6502-ASM);
- employ programming patterns;
- think and write critically about games.

## Deliverable

Submit your make study on GitHub (as a markdown document),
specifically reflecting on the design of your game and which patterns
you employed (or tried to employ). Your TIC-80 game should be exported
to HTML like we did in the earlier TIC-80 assignment. Your write-up
should be clear and look nice.  You will present your work during the
final exam period.
