These Atari VCS ROMS are examples from the 10 Print book project. There are several ROMS:

10Print-symetrical.bin 	a fixed but asymmetrical maze
10Print-asymetrical.bin 	a fixed but more natural-looking asymmetrical maze
10Print-scrolling.bin 		a scrolling but symmetrical maze

These can be viewed with the Stella emulator: http://stella.sourceforge.net

The Atari ASM code is also included for the scrolling version.
